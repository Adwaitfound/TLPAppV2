# Sample Data Guide (Removed)

This guide has been removed. The application is connected to your live Supabase database and no longer supports seeding mock data.

- scripts/add-sample-data.sql is disabled.
- Use the app UI or admin scripts (create-admin-user.sh, create-employee-user.sh, create-client-user.sh) to manage real records.
